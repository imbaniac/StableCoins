## Alive

### [Tether (USDT, EURT)](https://tether.to/)
*Total Supply - $2,323,989,840.56*
*Centralized stablecoin created and supported by Bitfinex.*

USDT supply: *$2,210,341,168*
ERC20 tokens:
- [*USDT $60,109,970*](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7)

USDT is centralized coin. You don't have coins, you have access to them with [their wallet](https://wallet.tether.to/app/#!/login) or with centralized exchanges.

*Exchanges: Almost all exchanges with USD pair are using USDT.*

>IMHO: Biggest and most stable stablecoin on the market. Despite being centralized, lived through all previous crypto-crashes and scandals.

**WARNING: At the time of writing, wallet isn't accessable from https://tether.to/**
